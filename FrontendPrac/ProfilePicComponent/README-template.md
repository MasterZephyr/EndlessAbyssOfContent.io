## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learnt the use of flexbox and how it allows for items in [<div>] to be resized and shifted. I also learnt a little bit more how position works when using absolute or relative.
```html
<div class="mainCardBG">
      <div class="TopPattern">
        <!-- Top pattern -->
        <img src="images\bg-pattern-top.svg" alt="">
      </div>
  
      <div class="BottomPattern">
        <!-- Bottom pattern -->
        <img src="images\bg-pattern-bottom.svg" alt="">
      </div>
    </div>
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    .mainCard {
        max-width: 375px;
        height: 667px;
    }
```
### Continued development

Honestly making this website was a challenge and i know for a fact there are probably may different ways in which it can be made. As it was my first time i would like a lot of feedback from whoever observes it so i can improve.
